# admin-dashboard

This admin dashboard was my final project for the Odin Project's Intermediate HTML & CSS course. 

I used CSS grid to reproduce the page design provided in the assignment prompt:

My design:

While the overall page layout is almost identical to the prompt, I tried to develop a coherent and unique design
concept with my choices for the color scheme, icons, borders, etc. The color palette is inspired by tones
found in Frank Lloyd Wright's work, but pushed into more muted, matte-like territory. Material Symbols provided
the icons for the page, and the page elements are defined by thin black borders and subtle drop shadows. 
Background colors delineate the various sections of the page, and minimal hover effects on key clickable 
elements enliven the user experience.

My goal was to create a clean, harmonious, and professional design that presents an original concept, and I
hope to have succeeded. The base page design process itself went very smoothly; pre-planning the CSS grid layout
allowed things to fall into place quickly, and then it was just a matter of playing with margins, padding, etc.
If I were to continue work on this project, I would focus on making it more scalable/mobile-friendly; currently
the layout does not change at small screen widths/heights.
